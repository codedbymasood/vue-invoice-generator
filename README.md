## Supabase RLS Policies (Secure Setup)

Below is the recommended RLS configuration for securing the `invoices` and `company` table in a multi-user system:

```
sql
-- Step 1: Remove any insecure default access
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users full access" ON {{TABLENAME}};

-- Step 2: Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE {{TABLENAME}} ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 3: Create secure, role-specific policies

-- Policy 1: Allow users to INSERT only their own {{TABLENAME}}
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own {{TABLENAME}}" 
ON {{TABLENAME}} 
FOR INSERT 
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Policy 2: Allow users to SELECT only their own {{TABLENAME}}
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own {{TABLENAME}}" 
ON {{TABLENAME}} 
FOR SELECT 
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Policy 3: Allow users to UPDATE only their own {{TABLENAME}}
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own {{TABLENAME}}" 
ON {{TABLENAME}} 
FOR UPDATE 
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Policy 4: Allow users to DELETE only their own {{TABLENAME}}
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own {{TABLENAME}}" 
ON {{TABLENAME}} 
FOR DELETE 
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```
